# Portfolio (React)

## Description

This portfolio was design to showcase some of my talents as a programmer using the React framework to display the front end information.  The website is laid out as a single page application (SPA) with several sections that can be viewed independently.  The header contains the nav bar that will default to the 'About Me' section and highlight the current selection.  The four sections are an 'About Me', 'Portfolio', 'Contact Me', and 'Resume'.  The page also contains a footer with links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and Stack Overflow.  The 'About Me' section displays a headshot of myself and a description.  The 'Portfolio' section contains six of my previous projects with links to the GitHub site and live website. The 'Contact Me' section presents a form to capture the users name, email and comments.  Error checking is in place to ensure all fields are filled out and a valid email is used.  The 'Resume' section contains a list of my coding skills and a downloadable link to my resume.
